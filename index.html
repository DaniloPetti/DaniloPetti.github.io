About me and my work

I'm a third year Ph.D student in statistical sicence at Univrsity of Salerno.


My research interests include both methodological and apllied aspects of Statistical Methods (The beaty of Statistics is that it can be employed in so many fields),
particularly within Survival Analysis and Variable selection methods. I'm currently working on Copula Survival Models under censoring schemes and Variable selection methods able to accomodate this complex class of models.
