<strong>About me and my work</strong>  
<br>
<br>
I'm a Ph.d student in Statistical Methods at Unisa,
I graduated in Statistics from University College London, UK, 
before then I graduated in Actuarial Science and in Economics at University of Salerno. <br> <br>

<br>
<br>

My research interests include both methodological and aplied aspects of Statistics
<em>(The beaty of Statistics is that it can be employed in so many fields)</em>,
particularly within Survival Analysis and Variable selection methods. I'm currently working on Copula Survival Models under 
censoring schemes and Variable selection methods.
