<strong>About me and my work</strong>  <br>

I'm a third year Ph.D student in Statistical Sicence at University of Salerno. <br> <br>



My research interests include both methodological and aplied aspects of Statistics
<em>(The beaty of Statistics is that it can be employed in so many fields)</em>,
particularly within Survival Analysis and Variable selection methods. I'm currently working on Copula Survival Models under 
censoring schemes and Variable selection methods.
