<strong>About me and my work</strong>  
<br>
<br>
I'm a Ph.D student in Statistical Science,
I graduated in Statistics (MSc) from <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL </a> , 
before then I graduated in Actuarial Science (MSc) from <a href="https://web.unisa.it/en/home/">UNISA </a>, I also attended the graduate school in Actuarial Sciences from 
<a href="https://www.unifi.it/vp-5123-storia-e-profilo.html">UNIFI </a>.

<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>

My research interests include both methodological and applied aspects of Statistics,
particularly within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Survival_analysis&oldid=1100337768/">Survival Analysis </a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Copula_(probability_theory)&oldid=1102457062/">Copula Models </a> and  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Generalized_additive_model&oldid=1096811323/">GAM </a> . I'm currently working on Copula Link Based Survival Models under 
censoring schemes and Variable Selection Methods applicable to them.
