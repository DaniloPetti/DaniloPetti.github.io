<strong>About me and my work</strong>  
<br>
<br>
I'm a Ph.d student in Statistical Methods,
I graduated in Statistics from <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL </a> , UK, 
before then I graduated in Actuarial Science and in Economics at <a href="https://www.unisa.it/">UNISA </a>. <br> <br>

<br>
<br>

My research interests include both methodological and aplied aspects of Statistics
<em>(The beaty of Statistics is that it can be employed in so many fields)</em>,
particularly within Survival Analysis and Variable selection methods. I'm currently working on Copula Survival Models under 
censoring schemes and Variable selection methods.
