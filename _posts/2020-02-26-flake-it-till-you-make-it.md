#### Summary
Consumption of coffee can trigger heartburn due to both caffeine and its acidity, the latter being affected by a wide range of factors not necessarily well-understood by consumers. This research examines treatments of three common ingredients -- the intensity rating of coffee grounds, addition of sugar and carbonation of water -- on the pH level of coffee using a single-serve capsule home espresso machine. Capsule machines are ideal in an experimental setting, providing consistent conditions for brewing and removing much of the operator variation. The experiment is conducted as a fully randomised $2^{3}$ full factorial design and analysed using ANOVA. Results suggest that lower acidity coffee is achievable with careful choice of water and may be a viable solution for those who suffer from heartburn. Although coffee intensity and sugar strongly influence perceived acidity, insufficient evidence is found to suggest they alter the actual acidity of coffee. Consumers would therefore benefit from standardised acidity information on packaging.

## Introduction

Heartburn is a common symptom of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and has high prevalence in Western populations [1,2]. Coffee is an example food often cited in medical advice [3]. In [4], a correlation between pH (acidity) and heartburn score is found within beverages, with coffee having among the highest scores. It is therefore hypothesised that coffee acidity may be linked to an increased risk of heartburn.


For consumers who suffer heartburn, reliance on perceived acidity -- which may not be a good indicator of pH [5] -- can lead to failed attempts to brew lower acidity coffee. This study aims to identify, within an experimental setting, whether three accessible treatments can alter the pH level of brewed coffee and not just perceived acidity.

## Materials and Methods
### Choice of Design Factors


Three design factors are considered for the experiment: coffee intensity, type of water and addition of sugar. 

A more intense coffee is anecdotally associated with bitter notes and lower perceived acidity. However, the intensity scales advertised on packaging are arbitrary (brand-specific) and how it relates to actual acidity may not be clear to consumers.

Entrapped $\text{CO}_2$ within coffee beans are hypothesised in \cite{navarin_waterquality} to affect the physical mechanisms of brewing when released. This study examines whether a higher volume of $\text{CO}_2$ released when brewing with carbonated water affects the amount of acid extracted. However, it was not known whether the lower pH of carbonated waters would mask this effect.

Finally, sugar is a common additive used to offset the bitter or sour notes in coffee, directly altering acidity perception. Regular white sugar is not expected to affect pH because it does not dissociate into ions when dissolved in water [7].


## Materials

Two coffee capsules, each containing $5$ grams of ground coffee, produced by \textit{Caff√® Borbone Srl} are chosen for the experiment: Black, marketed as intense and Blue, marketed as balanced. Capsules are hermetically sealed to prolong the coffee integrity compared to brewing methods where beans may have more exposure to oxygen. Nevertheless, dates of manufacture for all samples were matched to the nearest month as a precaution.

Efforts were made to select waters with minimal differences in mineral composition, although complete elimination of differences was not possible. One carbonated water \textit{Acqua Sant'Agata}, and one still water \textit{Acqua Santo Stefano} are selected, with an advertised pH of $6$ and $7.7$ respectively. Water was tested prior to use and pH levels were found to be within $\pm0.03$ of the specified value.
% Water was stored at room temperature and remained sealed until required.

3 grams of white caster sugar is measured with digital weighing scales (0.1 grams accuracy). Caster sugar is selected as the smaller grain size aids dissolution in the coffee.


## Pilot Trials

Numerous small-scale trials were conducted to refine the experimental procedure and reduce the effects of extraneous factors. A summary of identified factors and the control methods taken to mitigate their effects can be found in Table 2.1.


A larger trial run was used to conduct preliminary checks of modelling assumptions as well as estimate the residual variance for sample size calculation. No significant concerns were raised regarding modelling assumptions.
